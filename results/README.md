This subdirectory contains the primary result of the paper, Table
1, which contains all exposure rate constants, f-factors, and lead
shielding values for all 1,100 radionuclides.

The few f-factors that were erroneously listed as 0.876 in the Health
Physics paper have been corrected here.

Finally, all nuclides with no photon emissions have been left in,
for reference. These can be identified as having all zeroes in the row.
We think this may be less confusing than omitting them from Table 1.
